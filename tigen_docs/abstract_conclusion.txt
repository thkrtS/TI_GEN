TIGEN which stands for "Time-Table Generator" is a project which is based on the concept of Genetic Algorithm (Evolutionary Algorithm), which are meant to provide solutions for real-life problems. Genetic Algorithm is one the branches of Artificial Intelligence which is a very hot topic in the current age. Our project uses this concept at its very core. Apart from this, the project uses some other traditional and non-traditional methods like interaction with database system and providing custom data-structure for storage of data during program execution etc. for successful interaction and getting result from project. The project can be extended for any type of organization where there is need for schedule generation and hardware interaction with this project is also possible. The project will benefit in time-conservation and reducing manual work of the people who use to make schedules for their department/organizations and they can now put their effort more in other important tasks.


Scheduling is in the very core of the working of any department or organization to perform well. TIGEN is the project which is going to provide a great help and benefit regarding this task. It will help in doing this important as an automated process with very minimal manual interaction and the user can just sit back and relax or can do some other important task with the time he just saved. So, in this era of increasing technology and automation, TIGEN is another automation tool and helper for human so that they can leave this important task to the project and just focus on other important aspect of their jobs and lives.
